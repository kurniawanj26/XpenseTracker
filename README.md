XpenseTracker is an iOS application built with SwiftUI to help users track expenses, manage budgets, and analyze their spending habits. The app offers a simple and intuitive interface for logging expenses, viewing summaries, and categorizing transactions.
This app was created as part of my journey in learning iOS app development with SwiftUI.
